# HR Employee Attendance Dashboard

## Project Overview
In this HR Employee Attendance Dashboard, I've leveraged Power BI to track and analyze employee attendance data from June 2022 to May 2022. This project is crafted to assist HR departments in monitoring and managing staff attendance, providing key insights into daily presence, work-from-home trends, and various leave types across the year.

## Features
- **Attendance Trends**: I created visualizations to depict attendance percentages with daily granularity to spot trends and patterns over the year.
- **Work From Home (WFH) Analysis**: The dashboard offers insights into WFH percentages, aiding organizations in understanding the dynamics of remote working.
- **Leave Statistics**: It breaks down all types of leaves, including Sick Leave, Paid Leave, and more unique types like Floating Festival Leave and Bereavement Leave.
- **Customizability**: The dashboard includes filters and slicers that can be easily adapted to view data by specific dates, employees, or departments.

## Data
I use a structured approach to categorize each attendance type with specific codes such as P for present, WFH for working from home, and SL for sick leave. This ensures that the data captured is processed meticulously to provide reliable analytics.

## Visuals
- **Presence Insights**: Line charts track overall presence percentages across the timeframe, with annotations to highlight specific trends or anomalies.
- **WFH and Sick Leave Trends**: Area charts and dotted lines depict WFH and sick leave statistics, offering a visual representation of trends over the months.
- **Weekly Analysis**: I included bar graphs to show attendance statistics broken down by weekdays, which helps in understanding which days have the highest and lowest attendance rates.

## Usage
Designed for HR professionals, this dashboard serves as a tool for reporting, strategic planning, and understanding employee availability patterns. It aids in decision-making and operational adjustments.
